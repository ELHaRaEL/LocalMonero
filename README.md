API support has not been fully implemented.  
Due to the removal of Monero from Binance and the AML introduced, I don't know if the project will be completed.

Currently it is working:
- Calculate price formula
- Advertisement: create, edit, edit price, delete
- Account info (myself and others)
- Get listed buy monero prices (currency & payment method)
- Get dashboard (full filtred: active, buyer, seller... country, payment currency, payment method)
- Get advertisement filtred by all possible arguments 
- Get notifications (only new)
- Get monero average by currency (1h, 6h, 12h, 24h)
